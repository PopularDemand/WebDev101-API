*WWCode DFW WebDev101*

Data that powers [WebDev 101](https://populardemand.github.io/webdev101/).

Lesson content is found at `/public/assets/lessons`.

Lesson creation occurs in the `/db/seeds.rb`.

To create a new Course and/or Lessons, follow the examples seen there. The changes will not take effect until a new seeding occurs on the production database.

If you would like to contribute to this project, make a PR with your lesson plans, and I will add as contributor to this repo, the front end repo, and the production server.

Enjoy!
