## Welcome to WWCode Web Dev 103

This time around we will be loonking at a few concepts that, while necessary to grasp eventually, are not necessary for a basic site. These topics <em>will</em> make even creating a basic site easier, though.

### What's the plan?

If you are in attendance for the live meeting, you will be working through a live walk-through. All of the topics covered in the following lessons will be shown in the walk-through. Don't worry if you haven't worked with them yet; practicing with the walk-through will hopefully show you how simple these intermediate steps are once you understand the basics.

As always, our time together is limited. The walk-through will take most of the time. When you have time at home, check out the information here covering the following subjects:

**1. Positioning Elements** - How to have fine control over where elements on the page are located.

**2. Positioning with Flexbox** - Flexbox makes positioning elements for all screen sizes more intuitive. Heck, it makes positioning in general more intuitive. Learn to love Flexbox here.

**3. Git Branching Workflow** - One of the major pros of version control is being able to keep new, possible breaking changes away from code that you know works. We'll cover that flow here.
