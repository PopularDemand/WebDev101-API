## Welcome to WWCode Web Dev 102

_**PHEW**_

That first lesson was a mad dash and a doozy rolled into one. The good part is that *it's over* and now you know the basics of how HTML and CSS interact.

It's time to move into a high-level overview of the process of building a site. This will include the steps that you will take *every single time* you build a new project, so it's best to get these down pat as soon as possible.

**Didn't quite finish the first course?** That's fine. You probably got slowed down by one of these workflows. Go through these walk-throughs then return to the previous project. You will probably work through it faster.

### What's the plan?

As always, our time together is limited. You will be given *need to know* information and in-depth resources to follow-up with on the following subjects:

**1. Terminal / Command Line** - We'll learn to love navigating our file system without using a mouse.

**2. Text Editors** - We'll go through the most used workflows in Sublime Text and Atom text editors.

**3. Git Version Control** - We'll cover the top commands you'll need to always keep your programs synced and up to date. As a bonus, we'll cover using git to work in teams.

**4. (Optional) More HTML/CSS Practice** - Continue to work on the personal site from the previous course. Once you're done with that, let's build Google's homepage. It's pretty straightforward, but we'll need to cover a few more tags and properties.
