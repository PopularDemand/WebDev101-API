## You will need

1. **A terminal application**
    - Mac: On OS X, open your Applications folder, then open the Utilities folder. Open the Terminal application.
    - Windows: Open the start menu, and type `cmd` + Enter.
    - Linux, Ubuntu: Click "Search your computer" on your launcher. Search for "terminal" and select it.
    - If your OS or distro isn't listed, go to [this website](https://google.com) and type in "where is terminal on [YOUR OS]". Press enter.

2. **A text editor**
    - If just starting out, I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).
    - The text editor installation lesson will cover getting these up and running.

3. **A web browser**
    - I highly recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new).
    - If you must use Internet Explorer...
