## You will need

1. **A text editor**
  - My personal editor of choice is [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). It comes with all of the features needed for modern programming. It is a paid service, but it comes with an *unlimited free trial*. Thanks, Sublime Text!

  - [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor is beloved by many, many people. It is fully open source and has many (or more) of the same features of Sublime Text.

  - There are many more to choose from, but I recommend one of the above two. **It doesn't matter what editor you pick. What matters is the code you write.**

2. **A Web Browser**
  - Use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop).

  - If you refuse to use Chrome, use [Mozila Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new).

  - Safari if you're a rebel without a cause.

  - Different browsers offer different levels of support for the code and markup you may write. You  will eventually want to get to a point where your code looks great on any browser that opens it, but to begin with, make it look great on one browser.

  - For the record, the above three browsers work as well as another for 97% of the work you'll do in the beginning.
