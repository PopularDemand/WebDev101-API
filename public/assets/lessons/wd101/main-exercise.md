## Main Event

Recreate a site like the one found [here](https://something-like-this.surge.sh)

It doesn't have to be an exact replica. Make it your own, and have fun!

### Notes:

- Check out the [CSS Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) if you're feeling stuck, or maybe for inspiration!
- Icons can be found [here](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/social-icons-circular-black). Be sure to attribute the designer by linking back to their profile.

- Here's some boilerplate to get you started!

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>YOUR TITLE HERE</title>
    <style>
      
      * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }

      body {
        font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
      }

      /* YOUR CSS HERE */
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    
    <!-- HEADER -->
    <div>

    </div>

    <!-- PICTURE/QUOTE -->
    <div>
      <!-- cough*cssbackgroundimage*cough -->
    </div>

    <!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <div>

    </div>

    <!-- FOOTER -->
    <div>

    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```
