## Welcome to WWCode DFW's Web Dev 101 Series

Congrats! You've taken the first step to learning how to build a website &mdash; *showing up* with a *willing attitude*. With those two attributes, you can do pretty much anything you set your mind to, but for now, let's build a web site!

### What's the plan?

Our time together is limited. For that reason, the instruction found here will be focused on the *must have knowledge*, and you will walk away with a site *open to extension* to your heart's content. Resources will be provided.

Soon, you'll start to notice that web programs are a lot like Legos. Every new piece of knowledge you get easily fits onto your existing knowledge base. And the more you add on, the more extensible the program gets!

### What we'll build today

Today, we will cover some of the basic building blocks of HTML, CSS, and Git/Github.

You will walk away with a personal site deployed on the web for all to see.



How exciting! Let's get to work!
